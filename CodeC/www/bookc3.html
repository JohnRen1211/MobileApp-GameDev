                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Is C# code compiled or interpreted</p>
                <p class="g-des">C# code is compiled into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) before it is executed. This compilation process is known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
                <br>
                When you write C# code, it is first compiled by the C# compiler (csc.exe) into an assembly containing the CIL code. This assembly can be either an executable file (.exe) or a dynamic-link library (.dll). The CIL code is platform-agnostic and can be executed on any system that has the .NET runtime installed. The C# code is compiled into CIL code, which is then compiled into machine code at runtime by the JIT compiler.

                <p class="guide-title2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Extension of the C# file<p>
                <p>
                    The correct extension for a C# file is ".cs". When you save a C# source code file, you should use the ".cs" extension at the end of the file name.
                    <br>
                    For example, if you have a C# file named "MyProgram.cs", the ".cs" extension indicates that it contains C# source code.Using the correct file extension is important because it helps identify the type of file and allows development tools and compilers to recognize and process the file correctly.

                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Block of code</p>
                <p> In C#, the opening and closing curly braces {} are used to define a block of code, as I mentioned earlier. They are used to enclose statements and define the scope of variables and control flow structures.</p>

                <p class="guide-title4" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Get the data type of a variable ?</p>
                <p class="hs-des">
                    In C#, you can use the typeof operator to get the data type of a variable or a type. The typeof operator returns a System.Type object that represents the type of the specified variable or type.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    C# is a statically-typed language, which means that variables must be declared with their data types before they can be used..
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    C# supports garbage collection, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, making it easier for developers to write memory-safe code.C# is designed to be platform-independent. It can be used to develop applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, and even mobile platforms like iOS and Android.C# has a rich set of features, including support for generics, LINQ (Language Integrated Query), async/await for asynchronous programming, and more.
                    <br>
                    C# is constantly evolving. Microsoft regularly releases new versions of C# with added features and improvements.The latest version as of now is C# 9.0, released in 2020. C# has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source projects, share knowledge, and provide support to fellow developers.
