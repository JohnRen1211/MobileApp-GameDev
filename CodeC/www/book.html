                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p class="g-des">The Python programming language has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.</p>

                <p class="guide-title2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Who invented it?<p>
                <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum. He started working on Python in the late 1980s, and the first version of Python, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Guido van Rossum is often referred to as the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL) of the Python programming language, as he led the development of Python for many years and made key decisions regarding its design and evolution.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Print something</p>
                <p>To print in Python, you can use the print() function. This function allows you to display text or variables on the console. The syntax for the print() function is print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False). You can pass one or more objects as arguments to the function, and they will be converted to strings and printed.

                   <br>
                   By default, the objects are separated by a space character, and a newline character is added at the end. However, you can customize the separator and the end character by specifying the sep and end parameters, respectively. If you don't specify a file, the output will be printed on the console. Remember to use parentheses () when calling the print() function.</p>

                <p class="hs-des">
                    Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming. This means that you can write Python code using any of these programming styles, depending on your needs and preferences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In object-oriented programming, you can define classes and objects to encapsulate data and behavior. This allows for modular and reusable code, as well as concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Structured programming in Python involves using control structures like loops and conditionals to organize the flow of execution. It promotes clear and readable code by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Functional programming in Python focuses on using pure functions and immutable data. It emphasizes the use of higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and recursion to solve problems in a declarative and concise manner.
                    <br>
                    <br>                  
                    Python's support for these programming paradigms gives developers the flexibility to choose the most appropriate approach for their specific tasks and projects.
