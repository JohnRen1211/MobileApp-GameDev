                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Is Python code compiled or interpreted?</p>
                <p class="g-des">JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development and beyond. It is not related to the Java programming language, despite the similar name. JavaScript is single-threaded but supports asynchronous programming techniques for efficient concurrent operations. It has a versatile ecosystem with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js. JavaScript is easy to learn, has a simple syntax, and is supported by all modern web browsers. It is used by major websites and companies and is currently the most popular programming language on the web.</p>

                <p>Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to the Java programming language. JavaScript was initially named LiveScript but was renamed to JavaScript in 1998 for marketing purposes. While there are some syntactical similarities, the two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is a versatile language used not only for web development but also for various other purposes, such as server-side scripting, mobile app development, game development, and more. It can be used to create applications, libraries, standalone scripts, and interactive widgets.

                <p>JavaScript has a vibrant ecosystem with numerous frameworks and libraries available, making it easier for developers to write code and build applications. Popular JavaScript frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js, which provide powerful tools and abstractions for building user interfaces and managing application state.</p>
