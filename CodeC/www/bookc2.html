                <p class="g-des">C# is a statically-typed language, which means that variables and their types are checked at compile-time. This helps catch errors early and provides better code reliability. Additionally, C# has built-in features like exception handling and memory management through garbage collection, which enhance the safety and stability of applications.
                <br>
                Productivity and Tooling: C# has a mature ecosystem of tools and development environments, with Microsoft's Visual Studio being the most popular IDE. Visual Studio provides a rich set of features, including code completion, debugging, and profiling tools, which enhance developer productivity and make the development process smoother.

                <p>
                    In C#, Console.WriteLine is a method that is used to display output to the console window. It is part of the System namespace and is commonly used for printing text or values to the console.
                    The Console.WriteLine method takes one or more arguments, which can be of different data types. It converts the arguments to strings and then writes them to the console, followed by a new line character. Here's the syntax of the Console.WriteLine method:

                   Object-Oriented Programming: C# is a powerful object-oriented programming language, which allows for modular and organized code. It supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to write and maintain complex applications.</p>

                <p class="guide-title4" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Is C# case sensitive?</p>
                <p class="hs-des">
                    Yes, in C#, identifiers are case-sensitive. This means that the uppercase and lowercase letters in an identifier are treated as distinct characters, and using different casing will result in different identifiers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Consistency: Case sensitivity helps maintain consistency in the language. By treating uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters, C# ensures that developers use consistent naming conventions and follow the same rules throughout their code. This consistency improves code readability and maintainability.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Differentiation: Case sensitivity allows for differentiation between different identifiers. For example, variables myVariable and MyVariable are considered as two separate variables in C#. This distinction is important because it allows developers to create multiple variables or identifiers with similar names but different casing, each serving a different purpose.

                <p class="guide-title5" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Take Note</p>
                <p class="rev-des">Case sensitivity allows for precise identification of identifiers. It enables developers to refer to specific variables, methods, classes, or other elements by using the exact casing used when they were defined. This precision helps avoid ambiguity and ensures that the intended identifier is referenced correctly.</p>
