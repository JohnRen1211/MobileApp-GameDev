                <p class="g-des">In JavaScript, a parameter is a variable that is listed as part of a function's declaration. It is used to receive values when the function is called or invoked. The values passed as arguments to the function are assigned to the corresponding parameters, allowing the function to work with different values each time it is called.</p>

                <p class="guide-title2" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Who invented JavaScript?<p>
                <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich. He created the language in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, JavaScript was developed as a scripting language for web browsers to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Over time, JavaScript has evolved and become one of the most widely used programming languages, not only for web development but also for server-side development, mobile app development, and more.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Structure</p>
                <p>Statements: JavaScript code is written as a series of statements. Each statement performs a specific action or task.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Variables: Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript. They are declared using the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    Data Types: JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and more. These data types define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in JavaScript.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the function keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses. Functions can accept parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Control Flow: JavaScript provides control flow statements such as if statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements. These statements control the flow of execution based on certain conditions or criteria.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    Objects: JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, and objects play a crucial role in JavaScript. Objects are collections of key-value pairs and can contain properties and methods.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    Events: JavaScript can interact with HTML elements and respond to user actions or events. Event handlers can be attached to HTML elements to execute JavaScript code when a specific event occurs, such as a button click or form submission.

                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was initially designed for web development. It is primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites..</p>

                <p class="rev-des">JavaScript has a built-in event-driven programming model, which means it can respond to user actions or events such as button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.</p>
