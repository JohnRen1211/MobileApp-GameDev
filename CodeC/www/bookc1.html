                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p class="g-des">C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. It was introduced in the early 2000s as part of the .NET framework and has since become one of the most popular programming languages for building a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and gaming applications.
                <br>
                C# is an object-oriented language that combines the power and flexibility of C++ with the simplicity and ease of use of Visual Basic. It provides a rich set of features, including strong typing, garbage collection, automatic memory management, and support for modern programming paradigms such as asynchronous programming and LINQ (Language Integrated Query).

                <p>One of the key strengths of C# is its integration with the .NET framework, which provides a vast library of pre-built classes and APIs for common tasks such as file I/O, networking, database access, and user interface development. This makes it easier and more efficient to develop robust and scalable applications.</p>

                <p>C# is widely used in various industries and has a strong community of developers who contribute to its growth and evolution. It is supported by Microsoft and has a mature ecosystem of tools, including the Visual Studio IDE, which provides a powerful development environment for writing, debugging, and deploying C# applications.

                   Object-Oriented Programming: C# is a powerful object-oriented programming language, which allows for modular and organized code. It supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to write and maintain complex applications.</p>

                <p class="hs-des">
                    C# (pronounced "C sharp") was created by Microsoft Corporation. It was developed by a team led by Anders Hejlsberg, who is also known for his work on the Turbo Pascal compiler and the Delphi programming language. C# was first introduced in the early 2000s as part of Microsoft's .NET framework, and it has since become one of the primary programming languages for developing applications on the Microsoft platform.

                    <br>
                    Anders Hejlsberg and his team designed C# to be a modern, object-oriented programming language that combines the power and flexibility of C++ with the simplicity and ease of use of Visual Basic. C# was created with the goal of providing a language that is suitable for a wide range of application development scenarios, including desktop, web, mobile, and gaming applications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since its creation, C# has evolved and gained popularity among developers worldwide. It continues to be actively developed and supported by Microsoft, with regular updates and new features being introduced to enhance its capabilities.

                <p class="rev-des">Cross-Platform Development: With the introduction of .NET Core, C# has become more cross-platform. You can now develop applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux using C# and .NET Core. This allows for greater flexibility in targeting different platforms and reaching a wider audience.</p>
